Visit Us Mission Statement Policies and Procedures Strategic Planning 2025 Timeline Tuition and Fees About Montclair Montclair State University defines what it means to be a university with a public purpose — one that not only creates transformational opportunities for students, but also partners with communities to make a difference in the lives of others. Montclair invites students to imagine the world they want to live in and empowers them to develop the skills and knowledge to create it. As a solutions engine, we ask: How can we harness the power of 21,000 students and 1,800 professors to be a force for good in the world? This distinctive approach continues to attract students, propelling Montclair to become New Jersey’s second largest institution of higher learning, and one of its most diverse. Under President Jonathan Koppell, the University enrolled the largest entering class in the University’s history two years in a row. Founded in 1908, Montclair has grown big enough to offer more than 300 programs across 13 colleges and schools at all degree levels – and yet, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 17 to 1, is still small enough for students to receive personalized attention from professors and staff who truly care. Students have numerous opportunities to conduct research with professors who are respected leaders in their fields. More than 50% of Montclair’s students identify as underrepresented minorities. It is New Jersey’s largest Hispanic-Serving Institution, serving more Latinx students than any other university in the state. Montclair’s highly diverse students thrive in the University’s supportive, welcoming environment. Their graduation rates outperform state and national benchmarks and predictions with U.S. News & World Report ranking Montclair as seventh among national universities in graduation rate performance in 2022. It is consistently recognized as one of the most inclusive and best value universities and ranked No. 21 in the country in social mobility. Many of Montclair’s students are working and raising families, and the University offers flexible programs that give them the opportunity to learn in ways that work best for them, on campus or online, in real time or asynchronously. Faculty include winners of a MacArthur fellowship, Fulbright grants and Emmy awards, and NSF, NEH and NIH grants, among many other distinctions. These highly respected researchers, scholars and creators are dedicated to student success, and they are always innovating to meet the needs of learners and of the state. Montclair has launched dozens of new degree and certificate programs, and offers more combined bachelor’s and master’s degree programs than any other university in New Jersey – empowering students to enter the workforce faster, with stronger skills and for less cost. Montclair’s mission is to elevate its students and partners, and in so doing, help make the world a better place. Here you’ll find: Opportunities to develop leadership skills and achieve professional goals through a wide range of extracurricular activities A vibrant, expansive campus community Cutting-edge technologies, such as online study opportunities, that match our students’ learning styles Exceptional value for both in-state and out-of-state students Over 300 majors, minors, concentrations and certificate programs State-of-the-art facilities including a new 2,000-bed student residence and dining complex Exceptional opportunities for motivated students, regardless of ethnicity or economic background: described by the U.S. Education Trust as a “Top Gap Closer” for increasing graduation rates for minority students Yet students receive the individual attention you’d expect from a much smaller institution. Student-to-faculty ratio of 17 to 1 Average class size is 23 students Courses taught by professors, not graduate assistants Affordable tuition: one of Forbes’ 25 Best Buy Colleges in the Northeast Read about Montclair by-the-numbers and learn about giving to Montclair State.

This journey helped us understand our history, values, and accomplishments; our place in higher education in the state, region, and nation; and the ways we have been successful in moving the University from its inception more than 110 years ago to today. With advice and assistance of an external consultant, this process included: A review of the 2011 strategic plan and our signature accomplishments under it; An analysis of findings and recommendations from our 2016 successful Middle States Commission of Higher Education accreditation (MSCHE) report and study; A thorough environmental scan of relevant demographic predictors, labor market projections, technology developments in classroom instruction and program delivery modes (including active learning, low-residency, partially online and fully online programs), comparative degree production data among New Jersey institutions, and State funding expectations, all of which contributed to an understanding of the University’s market position; Two summit discussions with campus leadership, including faculty, staff, administrators and students; A SWOT analysis based on input from more than 550 University community members; Three presentations to and discussions with the Board of Trustees; Many dynamic conversations and extended working sessions by the Committee on University Effectiveness (CUE) and five Design Teams charged with shaping key success outcomes and strategies; Two public fora to which the University community were invited for open discussion of the draft plan; An extensive benchmarking study and comparison of universities through which 11 universities were identified that reflected significant achievements in areas of interest to Montclair State’s growth. This dynamic and comprehensive process was inclusive of the full University community, and it modeled the values we expect to cultivate in our University culture and in our students. The process enabled a rich and broad reflection of the pathway of change that has brought us to the current day.

The professor was outstanding, and I found the material covered interesting, practical, and applicable to my current position as a high school teacher. Enrolling in a Winter course allowed me to start my master’s program early, which lightened my course load for a future semester! It was so nice to focus on just one class during my holiday break, and I loved the flexibility the hybrid course offered when I returned to work. I would definitely consider taking a Winter course in the future. ” Noraellen Naturale , a graduate student who is currently in the Master of Educational Leadership program, spoke with us about their Winter experience. “Taking a course this Winter term allowed me to get a jumpstart on my master’s degree and earn three credits in just four weeks.

A Data Transfer and Usage Agreement (DTUA) is a legally-binding document that arranges the terms for the transfer between organizations of nonpublic data to be used for research. A DTUA is different from a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA), which arranges for the transfer of biological materials, and a Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA), which arranges for the sharing of confidential information. View more information on Montclair State University’s policies and processes regarding use of MTAs and CDAs here . Generally, MTAs and CDAs are used when an involved party is seeking a patent while a DTUA is enacted when a Montclair State University employee plans to share research data with an external organization. “Data” includes but is not limited to human-subjects data falling under the jurisdiction of an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Researchers working with data sets containing Protected Health Information (PHI) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) should refer to the HIPAA Privacy Policy . What is the purpose of a DTUA? DTUAs are intended to protect the confidentiality of the collected data, ensure safeguards to the research work conducted by Montclair employees, and clearly delineate the receiving institution’s responsibilities in handling the data in question. Who is involved in a DTUA? For an Montclair– Initiated DTUA A Montclair researcher planning to share data with an external organization, including but not limited to other academic institutions, private entities and governmental bodies, should recognize the need for a DTUA and contact the Research Compliance Officer. If the research project in question is sponsored, the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs should also be contacted to negotiate the terms of the agreement. A Montclair researcher may not independently enter Montclair into a DTUA; only an Montclair-designated official (e.g., the Director of the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs), may enter the University into such an agreement. The Montclair researcher is responsible for familiarity with the DTUA and should agree to the terms outlined therein. Terms should also be discussed with the recipient prior to drafting of the DTUA. For an Externally – Initiated DTUA External collaborators may request that Montclair researchers engage in a DTUA. A Montclair researcher may not independently enter Montclair into a DTUA. The Research Compliance Officer should be contacted first. If the research project in question is sponsored, the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs should also be involved in the negotiation of the agreement. Only an Montclair-designated official (e.g., the Director of the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs), may enter the University into a DTUA. The Montclair researcher is responsible for familiarity with the DTUA and should agree to the terms outlined by the third party. What is included in a DTUA? A DTUA will typically include: Involved parties and project Data description Period of agreement Use of data Confidentiality and security Methods of transfer The contents of a DTUA will be specific to each data set and more information may be required. Who should I contact if I expect that I will need to be involved in a DTUA? Ted Russo, Director Officer of Research and Sponsored Programs russot@montclair.edu 973-655-3219 If your transfer involves foreign entities, you must comply with Montclair State University’s Global Compliance and Export Control policy.

In this issue you’ll also read about how researchers are using mathematical models to understand ecological food webs and their resilience to climate change, human intervention and other environmental factors, and how others are measuring the now-shutdown Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station’s effects on the Barnegat Bay Estuary. Among the highlights of this issue are a look at how our faculty are working to stop alcohol, tobacco and drug use among Paterson’s youth; are advancing the understanding of the efficacy of biofeedback technology in dealing with speech disorders; and are exploring how a strong racial identity can attenuate the impact of online discrimination on academic outcomes.

Our University faculty researchers and staff engage in a wide range of leading-edge projects, including fruitful collaborations with colleagues from around the state, nation and world. Research areas of interest include but are not limited to: antibiotic resistance antimalarial treatments astrophysics autism biofuels cancer character development in scouts clean energy computational linguistics diversifying New Jersey’s teacher pipeline ecosystems environmental sustainability flooding risks gravitational-wave astronomy internet censorship neuroscience preventing sexual violence rare diseases school choice sicilian monuments speech disorders STEM teaching and learning substance abuse suicide prevention teacher retention A great way to do this is to start by checking out Research with Montclair . This site has faculty and staff profiles outlining research areas. You can also visit department websites and see what faculty are doing wihin each department. Keep an open mind and even consider looking for research opportunities in other Colleges at Montclair State. Once you have spent some time deciding where your interests are and you have explored active research at Montclair State, then you are ready to make a shortlist. Limit this list to three to five research faculty. Before you reach the next step, think about what your expectations are for research. Some questions to ask yourself are: Will you be able to commit to working on research over the summer or for an entire year? Do you have a few hours open in your schedule or will be you able to commit several days per week to research? All commitment levels are acceptable but you should decide how much time you can put toward research activity upfront so that you can communicate that to the faculty member. You may also want to think about whether you prefer to be part of a research team or if you are OK working with a faculty member on your own. Your initial contact should be in the form of an email or a visit during office hours. Let the faculty member know that you are looking for a research opportunity and what your expectations might be. Do not be discouraged if it does not work out with a particular faculty member. With such a wide variety of research topics and faculty members, there is likely a good match for you here, so keep going through your shortlist to find the best fit. Come up with a plan for your research activity. Your faculty researcher should be a mentor and help facilitate your research experience. One of the most important aspects of research is getting the word out to the world and your colleagues. Consider at least presenting at the University Research Day (April 2020). We want you to be a role model for other students and tell them about your research experience. Evidence shows that being involved in a research activity will improve your critical thinking and problem-solving skills. You might even decide to pursue research as a career path!

 Middle States Accreditation - Montclair State University Skip to Content Montclair State University Middle States Accreditation Menu Search Search Menu Middle States Accreditation Self-Study Steering Committee Middle States Accreditation Updates Self-Study Working Groups 2017 Self-Study Reports What can we help you find? University Twitter University Facebook University Instagram University YouTube University Tik-Tok Middle States Accreditation Self-Study Steering Committee Middle States Accreditation Updates Self-Study Working Groups 2017 Self-Study Reports Middle States Accreditation Montclair State University is an accredited institution and a member of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE or the Commission) www.msche.org . Montclair’s accreditation status is accreditation reaffirmed . The Commission’s most recent action on the institution’s accreditation status on June 22, 2017 was to reaffirm accreditation status . MSCHE is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education to conduct accreditation and pre-accreditation (candidate status) activities for institutions of higher education including distance, correspondence education, and direct assessment programs offered at those institutions. The Commission’s geographic area of accrediting activities is throughout the United States . Accreditation is a process of peer review and plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining the highest standards as an institution of higher learning. Colleges and universities apply for accreditation and, once accredited, must adhere to the standards of quality and integrity set forth by their accrediting organization. To maintain accreditation, the University must meet MSCHE’s rigorous Standards for Accreditation and Requirements of Affiliation . MSCHE accreditation assures students, their families, and the public of the educational quality of a Montclair State University education. Institutional accreditation is also a requirement for the University to participate in the Department of Education’s Title IV federal financial aid program. Scope of recognition: the accreditation and preaccreditation (“Candidacy status”) of institutions of higher education including distance and correspondence education programs offered at those institutions. Accredited by: Middle States Commission on Higher Education 1007 North Orange Street 4th Floor, MB #166 Wilmington, DE 19801 The Accreditation Process The University is scheduled for an evaluation in the 2025-2026 academic year. Montclair State University joined the Middle States Self-Study Institute in the fall 2023 term to begin the preparations for the next cycle of accreditation. Since the merger of Bloomfield College with Montclair State University on June 30, 2024, the two institutions’ accreditation process has also merged. Step 1: Self-Study The evaluation process begins with an Institutional Self-Study. The University has already formed the Leadership Team, the Steering Committee, and eight working groups consisting of Montclair State University and Bloomfield College of Montclair administrators, faculty, staff and students. In concert with the University’s leadership, all stakeholders will be reviewing institutional priorities and educational programs and services to determine how well they serve our students, accomplish our goals and fulfill our mission as a university, and meet the Commission’s high standards. We will provide periodic updates throughout the process to ensure the University community and alumni are aware of the status of our evaluation. The self-study design document and the final self-study report summarizing our findings will be made available to the public. Step 2: Peer Review In the next phase of the evaluation, educators from similar institutions will read our self-study report and conduct a team visit to determine if Montclair State meets MSCHE accreditation standards. As part of their assessment, they may endorse some of the suggestions made in the self-study report and provide some additional suggestions for institutional follow up. Step 3: Commission Review and Decision The MSCHE’s Committee on Evaluation will review all of the discussions, reports and suggestions and the Commission will publish Montclair State University’s accreditation status. What is the Middle States Commission on Higher Education? As a voluntary, non-governmental membership association, the MSCHE facilitates and supports the ability of higher education institutions to respond to a diverse, dynamic and global higher education community that is continually evolving. MSCHE accredits degree-granting colleges and universities in the Middle States region, which includes Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., as well as Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several international locations. Learn more at msche.org . How Does MSCHE Assist Institutions of Higher Education? The Core Values of the Commission clearly indicate their commitment to work with higher education institutions through self-regulation and peer-review. MSCHE fosters a “continuous and seamless relationship with member institutions to promote self evaluation and institutional improvement.” The Commission respects the unique mission of each institution and its evaluation processes and procedures for student learning outcomes assessment, effective teaching and institutional effectiveness. MSCHE is also committed to the principles of cooperation, flexibility and openness. The Commission assists member institutions in maintaining the high level of transparency in the accreditation process and in the status held by each member institution, as this is an essential component of higher education reporting procedures.

For Bloomfield students, the merger means lower tuition and fees and expanded student life and academic opportunities. As part of Montclair, Bloomfield College will continue to provide a transformative educational experience in a small, supportive setting with the resources of a doctoral research university. Below you will find answers to frequently asked admissions questions related to the merger. You can also learn more about this historic merger here. Prospective Students Can I apply to both the Montclair and Bloomfield locations? No, you can only apply to one location. Each location offers a distinct experience. Sign up for a telecounseling appointment so an admissions counselor can help you figure out which is the best fit for you. How do I tell Montclair which location I want on my application? You will see a question asking which location you wish to study at, and that is where you will select Bloomfield or Montclair. Once you choose your location, the majors available will be shown to you. What happens if I change my mind about the location I am interested in after I apply? We are happy to change your application information for you. Send us a note at msuadm@montclair.edu. Make sure to provide us your full name and date of birth so we can find your application. If you have already been admitted to one location, you may have to be re-reviewed for admission to the other location. If I start my studies at one location, will I be able to transfer to the other location? Can I take classes at the other location? Students can apply as an internal transfer between locations based on their major’s requirements. More information about taking classes between locations will be available soon. For Counselors What does the merger mean for my students? Students studying at Bloomfield College of Montclair State University still receive the close knit community of a small liberal arts college, but with the low tuition, resources and support Montclair is known for providing our students. Students entering 2024 and beyond will graduate with a Montclair State University degree.For students applying beginning Spring 2024, there is one combined application – both on the Common App and through apply.montclair.edu/portal/admissions . Who do I contact to have a representative visit my school? Joseph Niclas, Associate Director of Undergraduate Admissions niclasj@montclair.edu For specific Bloomfield College presentations or Immediate Decision Days, Nicole Cibelli cibellin@montclair.edu Where do I send students’ documents if they are applying to Bloomfield? Since Bloomfield is now part of Montclair State University, the application process has been unified. You can send all documents to Montclair through e-docs, mail, or e-mail (msuadm@montclair.edu).

Other factors considered in our holistic review process include: strong letters of recommendation from teachers and/or counselors; a well-written, thoughtful admissions essay; a commitment to extra-curricular engagement (for example, community service, leadership in student organizations and athletics, performance and artistic activities, and part-time employment); and standardized test scores. Each application for admission to Montclair State University is reviewed individually, and the admissions process is a competitive one.

This population of students encompasses individuals who have earned college-level credit or successfully passed credit-bearing exams before graduating from high school. Typically students have earned dual-enrollment credit from another undergraduate-level institution and/or successfully passed Advanced Placement exams. Exam Equivalency Charts can be found below. How can transcripts be sent? Institutions vary how they send official transcripts. We do accept electronic transcripts through verified servers (i.e. National Clearinghouse, eScript, Parchment, Credential Solutions, NJ Transfer). Transcripts received from a student will not be considered as official, so they will need to be requested from the Registrar’s Office of the previous institution unless another process is in place for the transcript to be sent on the student’s behalf. We do not request transcripts on a student’s behalf, and they are not automatically sent once the courses conclude. Official transcripts may be sent electronically to msuadm@montclair.edu or via mail to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions Montclair State University 1 Normal Avenue Montclair, NJ 07043 When are credits posted? Credits are posted to a student’s degree audit once a deposit has been submitted. We encourage students to send their official transcripts and verified exam scores to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions as soon as possible so that first-year schedules can consider those credits when being created. Frequently Asked Questions Q: What credits will you accept from another institution? A: We can accept a maximum amount of 60 credits from an accredited two year school and a maximum of 88 credits from accredited four year schools. We will not award credit hours for any remedial courses or courses earning lower than a C- unless an associate’s degree was earned. The Associates of Applied Science (AAS) is not eligible for this rule. Only courses with a grade of C- or above will be awarded. Please be mindful that bringing in significant credit may be associated with a higher student class level, but still not waive degree audit requirements. Q: Is there a maximum amount of credits from Advanced Placement (AP) or CLEP exams you will accept? A: There is no maximum credit amount for Advanced Placement or CLEP exams. The minimum score will need to be met in order for credit to be awarded. Q: How will my credits affect my first-year schedule? A: When making your schedule, your courses posted to your degree audit will be taken into account. We do not want you to retake any courses, so the earlier you send your transcript or exam reports the better! It makes it easier for you to get the most accurate schedule created based on any qualifying previously completed coursework. Make sure to complete your First-Year Questionnaire and indicate that you have completed dual enrollment coursework. Q: Where do I send my official transcript? A: You will send your transcript to the attention of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. We do accept transcripts electronically via transcript servers. Transcripts sent directly from students will not be considered as official copies. Our address is: 1 Normal Avenue Montclair, NJ 07043. Q: My dual enrollment course is posted on my high school transcript. Do I still need to send you a college transcript? A: We cannot award credit from a high school transcript. You will need to request an official transcript from the Registrar’s Office of the institution you earned credit from unless there is another process in place that a transcript can be sent on your behalf. Q: I took classes in high school and want them applied to my coursework at MSU. Can I still send them if I didn’t send them when I was initially applying? A: Yes! If you have classes you took while in high school and did not send the transcripts when you applied, we will still review your courses for posting. We encourage that you send them as soon as you deposit with us so that you can have the most accurate first-year schedule possible. Q: I took Advanced Placement level classes while in high school. Can I get credit for them? A: If no exam has been taken, no credit will be awarded. In order to be awarded Advanced Placement credit, you will need to send us a verified score report from the exams you have taken. Qualifying scores based on each exam will result in credit. Please see the equivalency chart for Advanced Placement exams to see what scores are required. You can review how to report your score by visiting College Board’s Sending AP Scores website . Q: How can I get my CLEP exam reviewed for potential credit? A: You will need to send us the official score report from the College Board. Review how to request your official CLEP Exam Transcripts . Q: I have taken CLEP exams and earned credit. Can you take the credit from my college transcript or do I need to request to send the exam to your office ? A: If you have earned an associate’s degree (AA/AS/AFA), we can post the credit to your degree audit from an official transcript that has the associate’s degree conferred. If there is no associate’s degree posted or earned, an official exam report will need to be requested and sent to our office. Q: Where can I see the equivalencies for Advanced Placement or CLEP exams? A: Please see the chart below for each set of exams. The equivalencies are subject to departmental review and change at any time. Q: If I took credits, but they do not waive any general education or major courses, will I still get credit for them? A: These kinds of classes would be categorized as free electives. The credit hours earned from these courses would go towards the 120 credit minimum you need to complete your degree program. We will do our best to review your classes and apply as many as we can to your general education requirements. You would work with your advisor to have courses reviewed for your major. Q: I earned an associate’s degree while in high school. Will you take all of my credits? What classes will be waived? A: We can accept a maximum amount of 60 credits from a two year school. We accept grades of D and higher once the degree is posted on the official transcript. If you have earned an AA, AS, or AFA degree, we will waive all of your general education requirements except for your New Student Seminar course. If you have earned an AAS degree, we will waive any requirements that are satisfied by previously completed coursework. Any remaining general education requirements will need to be completed. Q: I would like to take a course, but don’t know what will transfer over? What resources can I use to help me determine what I should take? A: If you are looking to take courses at a New Jersey community college, you can use NJ Transfer as a resource to see how courses will transfer to our institution. If you are not attending a NJ community college, please feel free to email our office any potential courses you are looking to take! Additionally, please review the general education courses that are required for each type of degree. Q: I earned credits through a program I participated in, but I do not have a transcript. How can I go about getting the credits reviewed? A: You can send us your certificate or document showing how many credits the program awarded you. Additionally you should send us any information on the program you participated in. We will review your credits and confirm whether or not we can award you credit. Q: I see my credits have been posted with the code “DPT”. What does this mean? Will the listed department automatically review my exam? A: Exams that are posted that require review for a course equivalent, may be coded with “DPT”. The credit hours have been awarded to you. However, you should start the process of getting the exam reviewed by working with your academic advisor to see if a credit adjustment is possible.

The ranking, by enhancing the University’s ability to attract and establish productive industry and academic partnerships, should lead to expanded opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student involvement and participation in hands-on learning programs and leading edge research initiatives. The new designation affirms Montclair State’s leadership in cutting-edge research projects funded by federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. Department of Education, and recognizes its recent growth in doctoral level education and research. “Montclair State has been successfully expanding its research activities in important fields,” says Montclair State University President Susan A. Cole. “This new designation reflects the efforts of our distinguished faculty and the programs they have created that both challenge students and address the issues facing society today.” A culture of scientific discovery Currently, a number of College of Science and Mathematics faculty have received strong federal grant support for their leading-edge research projects. They include: Sokol Professor of Chemistry David Rotella, who is helping the United States fight bioterrorism with the support of a $2.5 million, five-year contract from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Together with government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other scientists, he is working to develop inhibitors of the botulinum toxin, a potentially potent bioterror weapon. Mathematical Sciences Professor Eric Forgoston, who has received a three-year National Science Foundation award to develop computer models of fluid flows and mathematical models of control to determine how best to position the robotic ocean vehicles that are indispensable aids to coastal mapping, environmental monitoring, harbor security and oil field surveying efforts. Department of Earth and Environmental Studies Professor and Chair Stefanie Brachfeld, who directs the PhD program in Environmental Management. Thanks to a National Science Foundation Antarctic Earth Sciences award, she is working with international collaborators on a three-year research project to improve understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet’s response to warming climates. A dynamic research hub Even before receiving the Research Doctoral University classification, Montclair State had established a solid reputation as a research hub. College of Education and Human Services faculty members who have received substantial funding for their projects include: Jennifer Goeke, the University’s Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program coordinator, is in the final year of a five-year project, “Restructuring Preservice Preparation for Innovative Special Education,” which is supported by $1.4 million in funding from the United States Department of Education. She has been working to redesign part of the MAT program to prepare middle and secondary school math and science teachers to teach in inclusive classrooms – and increase STEM achievement for all students, including those with disabilities. Professor of Educational Leadership Katrina Bulkley recently received a $1 million grant from the Spencer Foundation to study the effectiveness of the portfolio management approach currently used to govern some urban school districts in Los Angeles, New Orleans and Denver. Funded research projects such as these benefit faculty and students alike. “Extramural funding recognizes high-quality faculty research ideas and offers students the opportunity to contribute to the investigation of these ideas,” explains Rotella. “These research projects can not only lead to valuable discoveries, but they can also lead to the next generation of research scientists.” According to Cole, the new ranking is an affirmation of the University’s successfully plotted growth. “In the past 15 years, the University has worked strategically and aggressively to grow enrollment, faculty and facilities,” she notes. “This growth has enabled us to expand educational programs and research initiatives in service to the state and the nation.” Today, the University offers students more than 300 baccalaureate, master’s and doctoral level programs.

In order for the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to make an informed decision on your admissibility, submit the following credentials in support of your application: Official transcripts (high school and/or college, depending on your level of study). Two letters of recommendation. Personal Statement. Standardized test scores if available are optional. (SAT or ACT: Students submitting ACT scores only must have also take the optional writing portion or the scores will be deemed incomplete for the purpose of making a decision.) Additional supporting documentation such as your résumé, awards, certificates or extra curricular activities. Though we take all factors into consideration when reviewing an adult student application, the Personal Statement is a particularly important part of the admission process. Your ability to describe your activities and intentions in a clear, concise and thoughtful manner will be evaluated during the application review process. Full consideration and thought should be given to the Personal Statement. When crafting your Personal Statement, you should demonstrate what you have learned both from formal education and from life experiences. The Personal Statement provides you the opportunity to demonstrate the educational value of your experiences and how they should be evaluated against a college curriculum.

If you are an undergraduate student (you have not been awarded a bachelor’s degree) who is currently enrolled and in good academic standing at a regionally accredited college or university, you are eligible to enroll as a visiting student. Enrollment as an undergraduate visiting student is a temporary status that Montclair State University makes available to students who are matriculated at other institutions. Visiting Student Application Requirements In order to be considered for admission to Montclair State University as a visiting student applicant, you must submit: A completed Visiting Student application . Important Information for Visiting Student Applicants: The status of “visiting student” is limited to a maximum of two semesters, excluding summer and winter sessions. After two semesters as a visiting student, you must file an application for admission to a degree program and be accepted before further enrollment will be permitted. If you have been denied regular admission to Montclair State University, you are not eligible to be a visiting student during the semester for which you applied. The Visiting Student Application is valid for one semester of classes only. A new form must be submitted each semester. The Visiting Student Application becomes available approximately two months prior to the start of a semester. Once processed, you will be eligible to register for open courses during the online registration periods. If you are intending to enroll in the fall or spring semester, you can register for classes approximately two weeks before the start of the semester. If you intend to register for classes during the summer or winter, you can register once the registration period is open for that session after completing the application. As a Visiting Student, you will be charged a one-time, non-refundable $25 processing fee for the entire summer or winter Session upon your initial registration for one or more courses. Registration may be completed up to and including the first meeting of the course as long as the course is open. It is advised that you register early to decrease the possibility of being closed out of classes. However, the University cannot guarantee that your preferred schedule will be available. Registering For Classes: You will receive a notification email with instructions on how to access your NEST account upon completion of your application being processed. You may then register for classes two weeks prior to the start of the semester by logging into NEST .

Vanessa Devericks, Lead Admissions Counselor for Recruitment Coordination, will help you set up your session. Reach out to her today at devericksv@montclair.edu . Answers to Questions for Current and Future Applicants How will pass/fail grading impact admissions decisions—now and in the future? Montclair State University has a long history of conducting a holistic review of all applicants. Unlike many large institutions, every single application at Montclair is thoroughly reviewed by an admissions counselor. Since becoming the first public four-year institution in New Jersey to adopt an SAT/ACT optional admissions policy in 2014, our focus has been even more keenly targeted on student performance in the classroom. The transcript tells that story, and we interpret it by considering factors like trends in performance year-over-year, the rigor of courses students are taking, and their performance in courses (like Algebra II, English, and other writing-intensive courses) that are indicators of success. With many schools—Montclair included—adopting expanded pass/fail grading policies, we do not expect any significant change to the way in which we review applications will be necessary. We will still conduct a holistic review, considering all factors– including the uniqueness of this moment in our history and its impact on students– and we will always err on the side of giving students the benefit of the doubt. As school counselors, you help us make those decisions by providing us additional backstory in your letters of recommendation. These are particularly helpful when students have complicated stories to tell. How will the cancelled SAT dates impact admissions decisions? Montclair has a test-optional admissions policy, so students applying to the University will be at no disadvantage during the application process if they missed the opportunity to sit for the SAT. Is Montclair State University changing its policy on Advanced Placement (AP) credit given the new testing model? We recognize that these are extraordinary times, so we will not make any changes to our existing policies related to accepting AP scores for college-level credit. Answers to Questions for Accepted Students How do students create their course schedules for the fall semester? All incoming freshmen complete the First-Year Questionnaire. This survey helps advisors build first-year students’ fall and spring schedules in advance of orientation. After the schedule is built, the academic advisor will invite the student to a virtual welcome meeting to talk about what to expect before the fall semester begins. Students will connect with their academic advisor during various Orientation activities this summer. At these meetings, they’ll learn more about creating an educational plan and be able to ask any questions about their schedules or next steps. Direct students to the Accepted Students Checklist for more information on the First-Year Questionnaire. What about placement testing? In most cases, your student’s academic advising team will use information from the student’s prior high school or college record to determine placement into courses at Montclair. Foreign Language Placement Testing All students at Montclair State University must complete or transfer in 6 credits of world language coursework to meet graduation requirements. If you plan to continue studying a world language you have studied previously, you must complete the Foreign Language Placement Test. Learn more about the test . Math & Chemistry Placement for Students in Majors within the College of Science & Mathematics Incoming freshmen do not require any placement testing. Your advising team in the College of Science & Mathematics (CSAM) will determine which level of math and/or chemistry in which to place you based on the courses you took in high school and how well you did in them. Special considerations: – If you have completed or are currently enrolled in a college-level math course or will complete a relevant math AP exam, you must email csamssc@montclair.edu as soon as possible with the course and grade/score that you expect to or have earned. CSAM majors who have not completed at least Algebra II in high school will not be able to take any CSAM courses and should contact csamssc@montclair.edu immediately for advising. – Students admitted to the Health Careers and/or EOF programs must take the Accuplacer and/or Chemistry Readiness Test (CRT). Students can contact the Academic Success Center at 973-655-5425, 973-655-4476 or email asc@montclair.edu for questions about placement into courses. My students have concerns about paying for college because their families’ financial situations have changed. Who can they talk to? Each situation is different, so we recommend your students schedule time to speak one-on-one with a Financial Aid Counselor who can best advise on their unique circumstances. Have them schedule a Telecounseling appointment with a Financial Aid Counselor today! Students have other questions about financial aid, billing or registration. Who can they talk to? A one-stop resource for any questions about paying for college, navigating our systems or planning for the fall, is Red Hawk Central . Please reach out to them for additional support at redhawkcentral@montclair.edu or 973-655-7600.

The most important of these factors is the student’s academic performance in high school, particularly the student’s high school GPA and the rigor of the courses taken (minimum course requirements plus additional, more comprehensive coursework as described below). Other factors considered in our holistic review process include: strong letters of recommendation from teachers and/or counselors; a well-written, thoughtful admissions essay; a commitment to extra-curricular engagement (for example, community service, leadership in student organizations and athletics, performance and artistic activities, and part-time employment); and standardized test scores. Each application for admission to Montclair State University is reviewed individually, and the admissions process is a competitive one. Each decision is made within the context of the whole applicant pool and the number of places available in our incoming class. Applicants for admission are expected to complete a minimum of 16 units of college-preparatory coursework as follows: Four units of English. Three units of mathematics (including Algebra, Geometry, and Algebra II). Two units of the same foreign language. Two units of a laboratory science. Two units of social sciences. Three additional units in any of the subject areas above. Students are recognized in the admissions process for pursuing a challenging curriculum beyond the minimum required, for example: Mathematics beyond Algebra II. Laboratory science beyond chemistry. A third or fourth year of a foreign language. Advanced Placement courses. Honors courses. Our strongest candidates for admission possess a 3.2 or higher cumulative high school GPA on an un-weighted, 4.0 scale, a challenging course sequence (particularly in the junior and senior years), and a well-rounded extra-curricular resume. Submission of SAT or ACT scores is not required. If you choose to submit scores, they may be considered in the admissions process. Please Note: Some College of the Arts programs require an interview, audition or portfolio review. The programs with one of these requirements are Animation and Visual Effects, Dance, Illustration, Music, Musical Theatre, Recording Arts, Theatre, and Visual Communication Design. More information can be found on the College of the Arts’ Admissions page .

Sometimes students are admissible to Montclair academically, but the faculty decline to admit them to their individual program. In this case, the student may be admitted Undeclared. Transfer students who have more than 45 credits cannot be admitted Undeclared, and will receive a communication asking that they choose an alternate major. Other times, the faculty believe the student’s unique talents are better suited for another arts program at Montclair. In that case, your decision letter will explain that to you. In both of these scenarios, you are welcome to change your major to something else, or, re-audition or submit a new portfolio during a later semester.

We based our decision on studies showing that SAT and ACT test scores are less effective predictors of college success than student performance in high school courses. Our test-optional policy ensures, as much as possible, that the students selected for admission are capable of succeeding in our rigorous academic programs. It also supports our mission of servicing a talented student body that reflects New Jersey’s broad socio-economic and ethnic diversity. Taking a holistic approach to the admissions process, we are able to focus on your actual accomplishments in high school. We consider various factors in reviewing your application, the most important of which is your academic performance in high school–particularly your high school GPA and the rigor of your courses. All applicants are expected to complete a minimum of 16 units of college-preparatory coursework: Four units of English. Three units of mathematics (including Algebra, Geometry and Algebra II). Two units of the same foreign language. Two units of a laboratory science. Two units of social sciences. Three additional units in any of the above subject areas. We also recognize student pursuit of a challenging curriculum beyond the minimum requirements. Examples include: Mathematics beyond Algebra II. Laboratory science beyond chemistry. A third or fourth year of a foreign language. Advanced Placement courses. Honors courses. We want to learn about you, your interests and achievements, which is why we also review: Strong letters of recommendation from your teachers and/or counselors. A well-written, thoughtful admissions essay. Extra-curricular engagement such as community service, leadership in student organizations and/or athletics, performance and artistic activities, and part-time employment. Should you choose to submit them, we also consider your standardized test scores. You are not hindered or advantaged by standardized test scores alone. Your application is reviewed individually. While our admissions process is competitive, each decision is made within the context of the whole applicant pool and the number of places available in each incoming class.

Application instructions can be found on our How To Apply as a transfer applicant page. Am I a transfer student? Montclair State University considers a transfer student one who has attempted 16 or more credits from a regionally accredited college or university after graduating high school or earning a high school diploma equivalent. Can I choose “undeclared” as my major on my application? The answer depends on the number of transfer credits you are bringing with you: YES – If you will enter Montclair State with fewer than 45 credits, you may apply as an undeclared student. NO – If you will be transferring with 45 or more credits, you must declare a major in order to be considered for admission. Will I need to take placement tests again? Generally, students arriving on campus with 24 or more college-level credits are exempt from taking the Math/English placement tests. However, certain majors that require higher-level math courses may require further testing. Also, if you have not successfully completed at least one foreign language course in college and/or your only experience with a foreign language was at the high school level, you will be required to take a foreign language placement test. When is the application deadline? Applications must be submitted by the posted deadlines to be considered for admission. Required materials, like official transcripts, may be received after the deadline. Are transfer scholarships available? Montclair offers $2,000 scholarships a year for 2 years exclusively for Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society members. Undergraduate Admissions does not offer merit-based scholarships for incoming transfer students. However, there may be scholarships available through your major. More than 72% of students receive some sort of financial aid, so be sure to submit your FAFSA ( fafsa.ed.gov ) and list Montclair State University (MSU Code 2617). Does Montclair offer an honors program for transfer students? Yes! Eligible transfer students may join Montclair State University’s Theta Xi chapter of the Tau Sigma National Honor Society after their first semester of enrollment. You can learn more about Tau Sigma on our Honor Societies web page . How can I learn more about your academic programs? You can browse through all our Academic Programs online. I’m a recently accepted transfer student. How do I register for classes? Accepted transfer students may register for classes after meeting with their academic advisor. What is the 2+2 program? Montclair State’s 2+2 program is an exciting opportunity designed for community college students that guarantees admission to the University for students who enroll at various community colleges and complete an associate’s degree. Learn more about the specific requirements and agreements with each of our partner institutions on our Montclair State 2+2 web page . What is reverse transfer and how does it work? Reverse transfer agreements allow students who have transferred to Montclair State from a New Jersey community college to complete an associate’s degree back at their community college while currently attending the University. Transferring Credit The college from which I’m transferring operates on a quarter-hour system. How do courses transfer in this circumstance? Students receive 2/3 of a Montclair State credit hour for each quarter hour earned elsewhere. This equation does not result in the loss of transfer credits. How will I know how many credits will transfer to Montclair State? At Montclair State, we try our best to ensure that most credits transfer, provided they are from a regionally-accredited college/university. For your own reference, we do not give credit for basic skills courses, ESL courses lower than level 100, or courses where the earned grade is lower than a C-. How many credits can I transfer? If you are transferring from a regionally accredited four-year institution, we do not currently limit the number of credits you may transfer. Keep in mind, though, that you will need to complete a minimum of 30 credits at Montclair State in order to receive a Montclair State degree. If you are transferring from a regionally accredited two-year institution (community college) or two-year program, you may transfer up to 60 credits towards your bachelor’s degree. Are courses in which I received grades of “P” (pass), “CR” (credit) or “S” (satisfactory) accepted in transfer? Generally, courses taken with a grade of “P”, “CR”, or “S” are accepted at full credit value, provided they are college-level credits from your previous school. Is my GPA from my previous college transferred to Montclair State? No, only credits are transferred from your previous college(s). I took a CLEP test at my other college. Will Montclair State accept CLEP scores? Students who earn CLEP credits through another college must submit official test scores to Montclair State in order to receive credit. (Please note: If the CLEP credits contributed to the completion of an AA, AS, or AFA degree from a community college, test scores are not required.) Please review the CLEP Exam Equivalency Chart . I took AP courses in high school. Will Montclair State accept my AP scores? Students who took AP courses in high school must submit official test scores to Montclair State in order to receive credit. Please review the AP Exam Equivalency Chart . Can I receive an evaluation of my transfer credits before I am admitted? Due to the large volume of transfer applications received, we are unable to conduct credit evaluations prior to a student being admitted. The evaluation will be completed shortly after admission and is available prior to paying a tuition deposit. Does Montclair accept D grades? In general, no: only grades of C- or better are accepted in transfer; however there are two exceptions: 1.When a D grade is earned through an associate degree (AA, AS, or AFA) from a community college. 2.When the first grade in a two-term sequence of courses is a D and the second grade is a C- or better. I am enrolled in a New Jersey community college and I am transferring to Montclair State. Is there a website that describes how courses will transfer? Yes. Visit NJTransfer.org . What is the advantage of transferring with an Associate Degree? Students who graduate from a community college and earn an Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS), or Associate of Fine Arts (AFA) will have fulfilled Montclair State’s General Education requirement. The General Education requirement will be waived. Does Montclair accept credits from the NYU Language Proficiency exam? Yes, these scores may be reviewed for transfer credit. All NYU Language Proficiency exam score reports must be sent directly to Rashida Batte-Bowden, Associate Registrar, at batter@montclair.edu and Adele Basile, Assistant Registrar, at basilea@montclair.edu . I don’t understand my credit evaluation. Can someone help me? We’re happy to help! Please contact us at 973-655-4444 or email transfermsu@montclair.edu for assistance.

If you are interested in applying for Spring 2025 or Fall 2025, check out our Transfer Application Day event on Thursday, December 12, 2024 . Step 1 Online Application Complete and submit the application for transfer students. After you submit the application, you will see instructions for paying the $65 non-refundable application fee (or submitting a fee waiver request) on the status page of your application portal. If you are applying to a program with an audition fee (Dance, Music, Music Therapy, Musical Theater or Theater), you will also see and be able to pay your audition fee through your status page. Apply Now Step 2 Transcripts College Transcripts Transfer students are required to submit an official transcript from ALL regionally accredited colleges and/or universities previously attended. Official transcripts must be sent to us directly from your previous college. Transcripts sent by students are not official. Please contact your previous college to have them send your official transcript. Official transcripts may be sent electronically to transfermsu@montclair.edu or via mail to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions Montclair State University 1 Normal Avenue, Cole Hall Montclair, NJ 07043 You may also submit an unofficial transcript for an admissions decision but your final official transcript will be required for enrollment.

This requirement is waived for applicants who have completed or will have completed an associate’s degree, or students who have completed 30 or more college-level credits at a four-year institution. Step 3 Test Scores Although Montclair State University no longer requires SAT or ACT scores, students with fewer than 30 completed college credits may submit their scores if they would like them considered in the application process. Step 4 Essay/Personal Statement Essays are optional for most transfer applicants, however, certain majors require students to submit specific essay(s). You can view majors that require essays and their essay prompts here .

Please note that a resume is required for Dance, Musical Theatre, and Theatre majors, but optional for all other programs. Transfer Admission Standards We review each application individually. However, when considering an applicant for transfer admission, strong candidates for admission generally meet the following criteria: A sustained, rigorous academic curriculum with an overall “B” average. A demonstrated interest in intended major by displaying academic success in the courses taken. If you have attended more than one regionally accredited college or university, the grade point average from all schools will be considered. Specific Admissions Requirements by College/School In addition to our general Transfer Admission Standards, certain programs have their own specific standards for admission.

Independent from the University’s administration, the students elected to the SGA author and enforce the rules that determine how clubs should function and how they’re funded. Each individual club is proposed by, created by, and managed by students. Whether you’re looking to find a group of people who share your interests, or you’re looking to jump into a leadership position, Montclair State’s SGA clubs and organizations can find the right fit for you. Some examples of the types of clubs overseen by SGA: Fraternities and Sororities Shared Hobby Clubs Academic Clubs Religious Clubs Social Activism and Political Clubs Mutual Support and Community-building Clubs Honors Societies Community Service Clubs The SGA even organizes local chapters of national organizations, like the NAACP, and international organizations, like the Golden Key International Honour Society. Here’s a selection of clubs and organizations run by Montclair State University students: The Montclarion Montclair State’s student-run newspaper, The Montclarion , gives students interested in journalism real-world practical experience that they can carry forward after graduation. Students who work on the newspaper learn a variety of skills, from research and editing to photography, layout and design – and with The Montclarion’s transition to a hybrid print/online format students will learn the web-writing skills necessary to thrive in the 21st century journalism landscape. The Montclarion is its own independent non-profit organization – not run by the SGA or the University administration – ensuring that it has as much editorial control over its content as possible. Latin American Student Organizations (LASO) As Latinos, we have flavor — we have that extra movement within our hips that can move people. LASO aims to add that extra hip movement at Montclair State by sharing our music, food, dance, stories and intellect with people on campus who might not know about our culture; we also aim to ignite that flavor among Latino students who are looking for a home. We are a FAMILY! MSU Players Montclair State University’s student-run theatre organization. MSU Players was founded in 1937 to give Montclair State University students the opportunity to create theater. Players does numerous productions every year, such as dramas, comedies, one-acts, cabaret nights and musicals. In the early 1970’s, Players became a Class One Organization of the SGA, Inc. which it remains to this day. We welcome students of all ages, of all majors, of every talent level! No auditions are required to be a member of Players! Future Educators Association (FEA) The Future Educators Association provides students the tools and resources to become effective, successful educators. Our focus is on the personal and professional development of students across campus, encouraging them to positively interact with our community, discover their pedagogies and ideologies, as well as to allow for seamless growth and success for one’s future.

Red Hawk Central at redhawkcentral@montclair.edu I Was Awarded a University Merit Scholarship Through Admissions. Am I Eligible for ScholarshipUniverse Scholarships, Too? Yes! You can receive as many scholarships for which you qualify. The only limitation is that your total scholarship and grant assistance (from all sources) cannot exceed your cost of attendance. Also, if you are receiving a scholarship from the University, it can only be applied towards direct costs – tuition, University fees, room and meals on campus. If those costs are covered by other forms of gift aid (grants, external and internal scholarships and waivers), your University scholarship will be reduced. How Do Outside Scholarships Impact My Current Financial Aid? Outside scholarships from all sources are considered aid. The total of your financial aid cannot exceed your Cost of Attendance . Funds received may result in a reduction or cancellation of your student loans or institutional grants. There may also be a reduction in your Garden State Guarantee grant based on the state regulations which limit this funding. I Was Awarded a Scholarship Through ScholarshipUniverse! Do I Have to Take Any Steps to Make Sure the Award Is Applied to My Montclair Bill? External scholarship providers will normally send scholarship proceeds directly to the University and the Office of Student Accounts will apply it to your NEST account. If you do not see these funds applied to your account within two weeks of being notified, we recommend that you reach out directly to the sponsoring organization.

Montclair State University is shaping the next generation of leaders prepared to address the challenges facing higher education today, including leading social justice, diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on college campuses. “It’s a critical time to do this work,” says Educational Leadership Associate Professor Blanca Elizabeth Vega. With issues of diversity, equity, minority-serving institutions and college access explicitly built into the Higher Education (MA) curriculum, the culminating projects of students in the master’s program include research on underrepresented and at-risk populations, everything from student success to faculty development, Vega says. The projects will be showcased on Friday, May 3 when the MA in Higher Education program hosts the annual Capstone Conference for graduating students. The event begins at 5:30 p.m. in University Hall, Room 1010. “Montclair sees its role as shaping future practitioners and researchers who understand the complex problems and issues in higher education and the changing demographics,” says Kristie Damell, an adjunct professor overseeing the capstones who works as Associate Dean of Students and Title IX Coordinator at New Jersey Institute of Technology. Angelica Martinez, at a recent campus event for commuters, is researching the barriers to participating in such activities. The capstone projects reflect the master’s students’ varied interests. For instance, two of this year’s graduating students are tackling issues in the University departments where they work. Angelica Martinez, graduate coordinator of Commuter Life, is researching the barriers facing commuter students in getting involved in campus activities and ways to improve their sense of belonging. “I’m working on a survey to gauge where that focus should be,” she says. Jake Hutchison, a graduate enrollment generalist for Montclair, is researching why students choose a certain school. “I’m working on collecting better data from accepted students to understand how to improve admissions practices,” he says. His research reveals a gap between the number of accepted students and those who eventually enroll. “I’m trying to understand why that is happening,” he says.

Montclair State University has acquired ScholarshipUniverse, an application that simplifies the search for external scholarships, further underscoring the University’s dedication to supporting students in funding their education as well as providing an efficient and user-friendly platform for exploring scholarship opportunities. “At Montclair, we understand that the cost of higher education is rising, and we’re committed to doing our part in supporting our students,” says Wendy Lin-Cook, vice president for Enrollment Management. “ScholarshipUniverse is a fantastic scholarship platform that our university provides for free to both our current Montclair State University students and incoming students who have already committed.” “This platform allows them to easily access well-vetted and viable external scholarships. What’s great is that there’s no limit to the number of scholarships a student can apply for,” Lin-Cook continues. “We believe that this will be an excellent tool for our students. We hope our students will take advantage of it.” According to ScholarshipUniverse, the app’s scholarship-matching tool gives Red Hawks access to millions of dollars in external scholarship opportunities year-round. ScholarshipUniverse reviews each scholarship before listing it, so students can apply knowing the scholarships are legitimate. Using ScholarshipUniverse is easy: Students complete a student demographic profile, answering questions designed to match them with scholarships for which they are eligible and then students can apply for an unlimited number of scholarships through the app. “ScholarshipUniverse is just one element of our broader institutional scholarship strategy,” Lin-Cook explains. “In the past year, we’ve made substantial increases in both need-based and merit-based financial aid to support our students.” “This combined approach, which includes ScholarshipUniverse, is designed to alleviate the financial burden on our students and promote their academic success and persistence,” she adds. To access ScholarshipUniverse, visit Montclair’s ScholarshipUniverse web page.

It is the first time the University has been ranked in the Top 10 on this metric. The University has also been ranked No.11 for graduation rate performance, which measures how well students out-perform the anticipated graduation rate of those with similar backgrounds at other schools. Montclair also moved up 19 places, coming in at No. 163 overall – its highest ranking ever – and reached No. 88 among the nation’s top public universities on this closely watched list of the best colleges in America. U.S. News & World Report 2024 Best Colleges Rankings At a Glance No. 7 in the nation in social mobility (up from No. 21 in last year’s rankings) No. 11 in the nation in graduation rate performance No. 88 among national public universities (up from No. 91) No. 163 overall (up from No. 182) The U.S. News results come on the heels of Montclair’s high marks in The Wall Street Journal /College Pulse Best Colleges in the U.S. rankings, released September 6. The Wall Street Journal /College Pulse Best Colleges in the U.S. No. 4 in New Jersey (ahead of Rutgers University and Seton Hall University) No. 104 overall out of 400 institutions (ahead of New York University, Boston University and Northeastern University) No. 37 out of 204 public institutions (ahead of The University of Texas at Austin, Penn State and the University of Maryland) The results are a confirmation of Montclair’s value proposition as an institution providing a rare combination of affordability, high-quality programs, research output, hands-on learning and commitment to student success. They also underscore why students are choosing Montclair in record numbers. The University recently welcomed its third-straight record incoming class, as well as its largest returning student population to ensure the largest total enrollment ever at more than 22,000 students. How rankings publications are now tabulating their flagship rankings – with an increased emphasis on student outcomes, return on investment and providing an affordable, rigorous experience that limits debt – only further validates the University’s mission of accessible educational excellence. “Montclair State University is one of the best universities in America, as the latest rankings confirm. Even more importantly, Montclair is tackling head-on the most common critique of higher education: that students take on unmanageable debt to get degrees that don’t help them, if they get a degree at all,” says Montclair President Jonathan Koppell. “That’s not the case at Montclair,” says Koppell. “These new rankings demonstrate that a school can be accessible, affordable, rigorous and excellent – and can do it all at a high level. We are not just providing an exceptional value. We are providing a truly excellent educational experience, and changing the lives of students and their families affordably without compromising quality. The time has come for all institutions to be evaluated on the metrics that truly matter, and these are the measurements by which Montclair State University is shown in the light it deserves.” For more information on the U.S. News & World Report 2024 Best Colleges rankings, visit usnews.com/best-colleges .

In the fifth year, students will take graduate courses required to complete the MS in Business Analytics Degree. Business analytics is transforming business and operations in all industries. It is the driving force behind efficiency and revenue growth. Advances in technology and the ability to obtain data has led organizations to employ more and more individuals in analytical roles. The demand for analytical professionals is projected to increase over the next ten years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that analytical occupations such as Market Research Analyst (18%), Management Analyst (11%) and Economists (14%) are growing much faster than average from 2019-2029. A career as a Financial Analyst is faster than average at 5% growth and Budget Analyst at 3% growth (average) from 2019-2029. In addition, companies are expected to hire more operations research analysts (which is growing at the fastest rate of 25%) to greatly improve business operations, supply chains, pricing models, and marketing. Providing undergraduate students the opportunity to add desirable analytics skills, knowledge and experience (through capstone projects or internships) in a relatively short period of time, can only enhance their job and career prospects. Undergraduate students will see the value in completing the combined program (4+1 Bachelors/MSBA program) to bolster their learning and employability, while also benefiting from some cost savings.

Combined degrees allow students to count graduate credits toward their bachelor’s degree and their graduate degree which allows for the completion of both degrees in less time. A combined degree program allows students to complete “swing-credits” (6-12 depending on the program) while enrolled as an undergraduate, which count for both their bachelor and master’s degrees.

Combined degrees allow students to count graduate credits toward their bachelor’s degree and their graduate degree which allows for the completion of both degrees in less time. A combined degree program allows students to complete “swing-credits” (6-12 depending on the program) while enrolled as an undergraduate, which count for both their bachelor and master’s degrees.

Additionally, students typically experience a significant cost savings when pursuing a combined degree program at Montclair. At what point during my undergraduate program should I apply?

The professor was outstanding, and I found the material covered interesting, practical, and applicable to my current position as a high school teacher. Enrolling in a Winter course allowed me to start my master’s program early, which lightened my course load for a future semester! It was so nice to focus on just one class during my holiday break, and I loved the flexibility the hybrid course offered when I returned to work. I would definitely consider taking a Winter course in the future. ” Noraellen Naturale , a graduate student who is currently in the Master of Educational Leadership program, spoke with us about their Winter experience. “Taking a course this Winter term allowed me to get a jumpstart on my master’s degree and earn three credits in just four weeks. I work full-time as a teacher in the Montville school district, so this Winter class was attractive to me. It was a hybrid course, which worked well with our district holiday break and had the flexibility I needed when I returned to work. The professor was great, and I enjoyed having the freedom to go through the modules at my own pace.

(Photo by John J. LaRosa) As a high school senior, Khara Brown advocated for a leadership conference for young women during a recruitment event with Montclair State University. Inspired by a similar program for boys, she urged University leaders to create the same opportunity for girls. After enrolling at Montclair, she helped plan and successfully launch the initiative. What she couldn’t have imagined at the time was how her own journey would come to exemplify the conference’s theme of resilience and courage. On November 21, Montclair hosted its 10th annual Women’s Leadership Conference, organized by the University’s Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF) . Centered on the theme “Triumph Over Trauma: Transforming Pain into Power,” the event empowered young women by addressing critical challenges like mental health struggles and trauma – issues disproportionately affecting underrepresented and low-income populations. For Brown, the theme of healing is more than just a concept – it’s a reality she has lived. After overcoming life-threatening challenges that began during her sophomore year, she has since returned to school and is on track to graduate in May 2025. At this year’s conference, she was honored with a Triumph Over Trauma Award, recognized in front of more than 350 high school students, educators, community leaders and artists. “It’s definitely not where I thought I’d be,” Brown said. “I didn’t expect to come this far, but I’m glad I did. I’m here in my grandmother’s name, and that means a lot to me. On days when I don’t feel like I can keep going, I remind myself that I’m doing this – for her and for myself.” High school scholars, selected for their academic and community achievements, pose with their leadership awards. (Photo by John J. LaRosa) The Women’s Leadership Conference – and its companion event, the Boys to Men Conference – serves not only as a source of inspiration and education but also as a pathway to enrollment. High school students are introduced to the admissions process, scholarships and support, showcasing strategies that emphasize Montclair’s commitment to breaking barriers and creating opportunities for Black, Latine, and first-generation women to thrive in higher education. “We want the scholars to know they’re not alone and that there are a wealth of resources to help them heal and grow,” said Dr. Daniel Jean, Associate Provost for Educational Opportunity and Success Programs. Khara’s Story In 2015, Brown faced a 97% fatality diagnosis after being hospitalized with catastrophic intestinal failure, paralyzed and barely able to speak. Despite the odds, she remained determined. In introducing her during the awards ceremony, Jean recalled: When the doctor said she had a 3% chance to live, she whispered to her mother, ‘If God created the world from nothing, imagine what He could do with 3%.’” Her resilience drove her through multiple surgeries and intense rehabilitation. Today, she is presenting original research, receiving prestigious scholarships, and exploring the complex history of free and formerly enslaved African American communities. She will graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Anthropology, with minors in Archaeology and Native American and Indigenous Studies. “I love learning about cultures, traditions and customs,” Brown said. “The more you learn, the more gaps you can bridge.” Throughout her journey, Brown was supported by her family and mentors, including Delores McMorrin, her EOF counselor, who shared a video message: “This conference exists because of you – because of Khara’s audacity to ask, ‘Why not?’ Her journey reminds us that our greatest strength lies not in avoiding challenges, but in how we rise through them.” Performances, Stories and Inspiration Members of the NJ Bomba Collective perform. “Bomba” is one of Puerto Rico’s African-based musical traditions and cultural practices, believed to be over 400 years old. (Photo by John J. LaRosa) “Themes like ‘Triumph Over Trauma’ emphasize resilience, self-advocacy and the importance of embracing one’s story – no matter how challenging,” said EOF Counselor and Academic Advisor Jazmene Mosley, a co-organizer. Co-sponsored by the Office of Residence Life, the event provided young women with a transformative experience designed to shape their high school journey as they prepare for college. Highlights: Healing Drum Ritual: The NJ Bomba Collective showcased music’s role as a cultural tool for healing, strength and resilience. Empowerment Poetry: Alyea Pierce, a Fulbright recipient and National Geographic Explorer, shared her poetry, inspiring young women with the transformative power of words and storytelling. 7 Days That Changed a Life: Karima Mary McKenzie, a Jersey City vice principal, recounted her battle with mental illness and the seven-day hospital stay that changed her life. Her experience inspired her to write a guidebook for young women emphasizing exercise, nutrition and meditation for wellness.

(Photo by John J. LaRosa) “Today, we celebrate not just survival, but the extraordinary ability to transform our struggles into sources of growth and empowerment,” said Katrina Liera, Associate Director of Montclair’s EOF program. Awards were presented to women whose lasting contributions have driven meaningful change in their communities: Impact Award Carmen Reyes Cuevas was honored for over 30 years of service in the EOF program, helping countless students achieve their educational goals. Recently, she secured a $135,000 EOF Graduate Grant to support graduate studies for New Jersey residents from underserved backgrounds.

Lakeesha Eure: First Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Director of Newark’s Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery. She leads efforts to reduce crime and promote healing in Newark. “We want to highlight that we can stand strong together as women and support one another through difficult times. My hope is that someone will hear a story that encourages them to persevere through difficult times,” said EOF Counselor and Academic Advisor Angela A. White, co-organizer of Montclair State University’s 10th Annual Women’s Leadership Conference. (Photo by John J. LaRosa) “We are all capable of making a change,” said Montclair senior Jezebel Dejesus during a student panel discussion. “It definitely starts within you, and if you ever feel small, know there’s a space for you – you just have to demand it.” Are You A … Prospective Student or Parent?

The second phase of One Square Mile is the result of a yearlong effort to understand the needs of the community through the formation of the Paterson One Square Mile Community Advisory Committee of community leaders in Paterson. The pilot phase of the initiative was made possible through support from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation . After working to turn Paterson’s Eastside High School into a University-assisted community school , Phase 2 of One Square Mile will focus on creating housing solutions for Paterson residents in the first, fourth and fifth wards of the city over the next five years. “The Paterson One Square Mile is how big change happens,” says Montclair President Jonathan Koppell. “A public-spirited university, committed to making a difference, is working hand-in-hand with creative, energized community partners. Supported by visionary, philanthropic investment, they are altering the trajectory of our communities. I can’t wait to see what happens next in Paterson, and across New Jersey.” “The community led us to where we are today,” says Transform Consulting Group President Amanda Lopez. “Over 500 Paterson residents helped Paterson One Square Mile identify housing as their top priority and how they want to see housing addressed. The community came together to create a comprehensive plan. We are excited to share this housing action plan and invite others to join in implementing the plan.” Housing Statistics in Paterson, NJ Within One Square Mile’s designated area: The population has increased by 11% in the last 10 years – more than four times the rate of the rest of Passaic County (2.4%) and nearly twice the rate of the city of Paterson (7.4%) Residents have the highest rate (5%) of people living in overcrowded housing 58% of OSM residents are “rent-burdened” – which means they are paying more than 30% of their monthly income towards housing costs92% of OSM residents are renters, leaving only 8% as homeowners One Square Mile Phase Two Goals After listening to community leaders to identify housing challenges, Montclair State University and Transform Consulting Group assisted in developing five housing goals that will be pursued over the next five years. Expand Housing Affordability: The Community Advisory Committee will look to expand affordable housing opportunities and advocate to create policies to expand opportunities. Increase Supply and Stability: Working with the City of Paterson, the Committee will seek to turn abandoned buildings and underutilized space into affordable housing, as well as create an eviction protection program to increase stability. Improve Housing Quality: The Committee will work to increase energy efficiency for residents and create safe housing in the One Square Mile area. Create Housing and Safe Neighborhoods: Wraparound services will be expanded for residents to help ensure safe neighborhoods and community leader programming will be developed to foster the next generation of community leaders to ensure the area’s continued growth. Build Assets and Wealth: The Committee will create programming to educate residents on the benefits of homeownership as opposed to renting, and how it can create generational wealth for the city. “The One Square Mile housing plan draws from proven strategies that have successfully created affordable, sustainable housing across New Jersey and the nation,” says Passaic County Habitat for Humanity CEO Scott Millard. ”By implementing evidence-based policies — such as requiring 20% affordable units in new developments and mandating that 60% of units be two-or three-bedroom apartments suitable for families — Paterson can better serve its residents while ensuring responsible development. Together with our partners at Montclair State University and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, we urge the City Administration, Council, and Boards to adopt these recommendations to create lasting positive change for our community.” Montclair State University and the City of Paterson The second phase of One Square Mile is the latest achievement in the expanding relationship between Montclair State University and the City of Paterson. The University opened The Charles J. Muth Museum of Hinchliffe Stadium in April of 2024, which engages audiences in the history of the Negro Leagues and its famous players while creating learning opportunities for both Montclair students and the students of Paterson Public Schools. “This is a significant milestone in our shared vision for a stronger, more resilient Paterson,” says Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh. “Through the One Square Mile Initiative, we are addressing one of the most pressing needs in our community – affordable and stable housing. The partnership with Montclair State University, the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, and our local leaders exemplifies the power of collaboration in creating meaningful change. Together, we are transforming challenges into opportunities, ensuring that every family in Paterson has access to safe, quality housing and the resources they need to thrive.” Montclair State University Address: 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, New Jersey 0 7 0 4 3 1 Normal Ave. Montclair, NJ 07043 Phone Number: 973-655-4000 Campus Map University Twitter University Facebook University Instagram University YouTube University TikTok Press Room Contact Media Relations University News Faculty Experts Media Library Montclair Magazine Montclair State University About Montclair Academics Admissions Alumni Arts and Culture Athletics Red Hawk Life Giving Research Bloomfield College Merger Policies Copyright and Disclaimer Title IX Information Emergency/Plans Notice of Non-Discrimination Annual Security Report Middle States Accreditation Website Privacy Notice Land Acknowledgement Statement Cost of Attendance Return to Top

The project, titled The Effectiveness of Psychoeducational Counseling in STEM Internship and Research Experiences , will be led by an interdisciplinary team and will seek to: Increase participation in high-quality STEM experiential learning opportunities across Montclair Embed professional group counseling into internships and research experiences to create opportunities with socio-emotional support Generate knowledge on the impacts of this counseling intervention on students, faculty mentors and program coordinators at a federally designated HSI. The project will be led by Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Nina Goodey and a team of co-PIs including PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies (PSEG ISS) Green Teams Director Amy Tuininga , Associate Professor of Counseling Michael Hannon and Dean of Montclair’s College of Science and Mathematics Lora Billings . The project has strong support from the University’s administration and contributes their HSI expertise as senior personnel. Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, Junius Gonzales, brings his expertise in Hispanic students’ mental health and commitment to reduce equity gaps for student achievement and grow student internship and research opportunities. Milton Fuentes, Department of Psychology and MSU Provost’s Higher Education Academic Leadership Fellow, brings to the project a deep understanding of Hispanic students, mental health, and expertise in Latinx, multicultural, and family psychology. About the Institutional Transformation Project While students benefit from internship experiences, Tuininga and Goodey were keenly aware of how internships often lacked the elements required for students with a breadth of identities and life experiences to feel a sense of belonging, particularly in STEM fields. “Mature scientists know that STEM projects often involve setbacks and that embracing these challenges, with responsive support, can lead to persistence and unexpected scientific breakthroughs,” says Goodey. “The magnitude of these challenges can exacerbate psychological distress for all researchers, and particularly those with less experience and who are still adjusting to and embracing their STEM career identities.” From 2022-2024, they partnered with Hannon to add weekly psychoeducational group counseling sessions for the interns in Montclair’s Green Teams program facilitated by PhD Counseling students, who are professional counselors. “The PSEG ISS is pleased to lead innovation in best practices for responsive and inclusive internship experiences, like mental health support for young people that is much needed, particularly after COVID,” says Tuininga. After its success and as part of this project, they plan to expand the services to students in CSAM’s Summer Undergraduate Research Program in the coming years. Now, the team will work to quantify the impact of group counseling on internship and research participants and expand the program across Montclair with additional support from Montclair’s Office of the Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Junius Gonzales . “Mental health support and education is key to supporting wellness, productivity, and managing stress in both research and education,” says Billings. “This project will empower all students to persist in STEM and holistically prepare them to succeed in the future workforce. Montclair State University is proud to be a leader in quantifying the value of the mental health support services.” “The inclusion of counseling support for students participating in these internship and research experiences is exactly the kind of proactive, preventative services that all students deserve. The award from the National Science Foundation positions our institution to be innovative in disrupting exclusion in higher education and to be holistically responsive to student needs. We are hopeful that the comprehensive scope of services will be nothing short of transformational for the students, for those of us privileged to engage with and serve them, and for Montclair State University,” says Hannon.

The Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announced today that it has once again named the University a Fulbright Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Leader for 2024, one of only 50 colleges and universities in the country to earn the federal designation. Montclair has earned the designation each year since its inception in 2021. Last year, the University was one of only 46 institutions to receive the recognition. The Fulbright Program is the U.S. government’s flagship international academic exchange program. Since its inception more than 75 years ago, the Fulbright Program has given more than 400,000 talented and accomplished students, scholars, teachers, artists and professionals of all backgrounds and fields the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research abroad, exchanging ideas and contributing to finding solutions to complex international challenges. Founded in 1946 by U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright, the program bestows several types of awards. The Fulbright U.S. Student Program grants scholarships to U.S. graduating seniors, graduate students, young professionals, scientists and artists selected through a national, merit-based competition for study, research, and English teaching abroad. Montclair has been especially active in the English Teaching Assistant Program, which places U.S. students, primarily new college graduates, as English teaching assistants in schools or universities overseas, where they increase foreign students’ English language abilities and knowledge of the United States. Since 2008, the program has provided eight Montclair students, chosen for their academic merit and leadership potential, with the opportunity to engage in these high-quality educational opportunities abroad. Montclair has also enrolled 90 international students who received the Fulbright Foreign Student award to study at Montclair, and 18 Montclair faculty have become finalists and been awarded with the Fulbright U.S. Scholar award. Montclair was chosen as a Fulbright HSI Leader for its noteworthy level of engagement with the Fulbright Program and for its success in helping students and faculty benefit from a variety of on-campus Fulbright initiatives, including the U.S. Student Program, the U.S. Scholar Program, the Foreign Student Program, the Fulbright Gateway Program, the Fulbright Outreach Lecturing Fund, the Fulbright Visiting Scholars Program, the Fulbright Development Initiative, the Fulbright Features at Montclair newsletter, and Fulbright Association and alumni events. Most recently, Montclair advised and interviewed a record-setting 32 applicants who “hit submit” for the 2025-26 U.S. Student Program. Designated an HSI in 2016, Montclair has created an inclusive environment to support the success of all Hispanic students, faculty and staff through its Office of Hispanic Initiatives . Approximately 45% of the University’s record-breaking incoming class for the fall 2024 semester and 36% of the total undergraduate student body identifies as Hispanic, reflecting the rich diversity of New Jersey and Montclair’s surrounding area. “Montclair State University is committed to changing students’ lives by providing educational opportunities around the world,” says Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Junius Gonzales. “We are honored to receive this recognition for the fourth year in a row, and look forward to realizing all of the incredible possibilities for students that the Fulbright Program provides.” I’m a ____, tell me more: Prospective Student / Parent: Learn more about what it means to be a Hispanic-Serving Institution , or take the next step and apply to become a Red Hawk !
